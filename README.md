# graph-coloring-red-black-tree

This project involved implementing a solution for graph coloring using greedy algorithms and managing a dictionary using Red Black Trees. The primary objective was to generate a conflict-free final exam schedule for students at Carnegie Mellon University by processing class schedule data.

# Key Tasks
<ul>
  <li>Graph Construction: Built an adjacency matrix from the input data file, where vertices represent courses and edges represent student enrollment in multiple courses.</li>
  <li>Graph Coloring: Applied a greedy algorithm to color the graph, ensuring no two adjacent vertices (courses with common students) share the same color, thus preventing exam schedule conflicts.</li>
  <li>Red Black Trees: Implemented a dictionary as a Red Black Tree to efficiently manage course names and their corresponding integer identifiers.</li>
  <li>File Processing: Read and parsed the input data file, and generated the required output formats, including the adjacency matrix and the final exam schedule.</li>
</ul>

# Skills Demonstrated
<ul>
  <li>Java Programming: Writing efficient and well-structured Java code.</li>
  <li>Data Structures: Utilizing graphs, adjacency matrices, and Red Black Trees.</li>
  <li>Algorithms: Implementing and applying greedy algorithms.</li>
  <li>File I/O Operations: Handling file reading and writing operations.</li>
</ul>

The project achieved an efficient method for scheduling exams, ensuring no student had overlapping exams, and provided a comprehensive, well-documented solution with an emphasis on code readability and maintainability.
